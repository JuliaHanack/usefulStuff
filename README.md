# Introduction

In this repository I store random files for future reference. I worked on those data as a QA Engineer for my previous work at Delivery Hero. Most data is related to UI automation with a focus on Selenium and NightwatchJS, written in Javascript.

Scripts stored in this repository are partially confidential and therefore dependencies are either removed or manipulated on purpose in order to exclude business sensitive data. They will not run unless they're modified/added. 

The original scripts were running in dev environment & production for formerly www.lieferheld.de (now https://www.lieferando.de/).

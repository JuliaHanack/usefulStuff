In this repository I store some random files for future reference I came upon my work as a QA Engineer. Most of the information are test automation related with a focus on Selenium and Nightwatch.

Scripts stored in this repository are often adjusted or required files are missing on purpose so no sensitive data can be read from it. They will not run unless they're modified/added. The original scripts were running in production for www.lieferheld.de.

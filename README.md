# Introduction

In this repository I store some random files for future reference I came upon my work as a QA Engineer. Most of the data are related to UI automation with a focus on Selenium and NightwatchJS.

Scripts stored in this repository are often adjusted and/or required files are missing on purpose in order to exclude business sensitive data. They will not run unless they're modified/added. 

The original scripts were running in production for www.lieferheld.de.

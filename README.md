# Introduction

In this repository I store some random files for future reference I came upon my work as a QA Engineer. Most data is related to UI automation with a focus on Selenium and NightwatchJS, written in Javascript.

Scripts stored in this repository are often manipulated and required files are removed on purpose in order to exclude business sensitive data. They will not run unless they're modified/added. 

The original scripts were running in dev environment & production for www.lieferheld.de.
